# html-portfolio
This project is my first simple HTML-based portfolio website designed to showcase my learnings. The portfolio is structured using semantic HTML elements to enhance readability and accessibility. It serves as a foundational step in my web development journey, with plans for future enhancements and styling using CSS.
