<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Imane Azdoud, and I'm currently embarking on an exciting journey to become a full-stack web developer through Angela Yu’s comprehensive course. This program covers a wide array of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps. I’m thrilled to dive into these subjects and expand my skill set in the tech world.</p>

<p>With a background in international business, I bring a unique perspective to my new venture in web development. I have honed my skills as an account manager at an ad tech company, where I’ve learned the importance of effective communication and problem-solving in a fast-paced environment. This experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in understanding client needs and delivering solutions that drive results.</p>

<p>As I transition into this new field, my curiosity about mobile and web development continues to grow. I am eager to learn and apply my knowledge to create innovative and user-friendly applications. I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and sharing insights as we explore the dynamic world of technology together!</p>
